# What is Jaci?
Java Annotation Command Interface.  
Jaci generates User Interfaces (CLI/GUI) from annotated methods, which can then be embedded into your application.

# What is Jaci for?
Jaci is geared towards 2 things:

1. Creating debug consoles - A debug console doesn't need to look pretty, it needs to be convenient to work with (at runtime) and convenient to add commands to (at dev time).
2. Creating quick, throw-away prototype code - When you just need to quickly test some logic (or learn a new API), just write the logic, add annotations and let Jaci generate the UI.
